silent-npm-registry-client\n\nA version of\n[npm-registry-client](https://github.com/isaacs/npm-registry-client) that\ndoesn't spam stdout/stderr by default.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar RegClient = require('silent-npm-registry-client');\nvar os = require('os');\n\nvar client = new RegClient({\n  registry: 'http://registry.npmjs.org/',\n  cache: os.tmpDir() + '/' + Math.random().toString(16).slice(2)\n});\n\nclient.get('/browserify', function (err, pkg) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log('got pkg with keys [%s]', Object.keys(pkg).join(', '));\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe API is exactly the same as\n[npm-registry-client](https://github.com/isaacs/npm-registry-client)'s, except\nthat `options.log` falls back to not logging, even if `npm-log` is installed.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do\n\n```bash\n$ npm install silent-npm-registry-client\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Julian Gruber
